```md
# AI Resume Matcher 🚀

...
```

```

```

This makes GitHub treat the entire README as one big code block — which is why it doesn’t render the headings, lists, or links properly.

### ✅ Final Fix: **Remove the outer `md ... ` wrapper**

Just remove the very first line and last line:

````diff
- ```md
... (all your good content here)
- ```
````

So your final `README.md` should look like this:

---

### ✅ Final, Copy-Ready Version (no outer code block)

````md
